## Basic Validation
The Laundry Planner app checks that all user inputs are correct before doing any calculations.First, it makes sure every text box is filled. If something is empty, a warning message will appear using a SnackBar to remind the user to complete all fields.

Next, the app uses int.tryParse() to check that users only enter numbers. If the user types letters or symbols, it will show a message like “Invalid input like "please enter a number.” The app also checks that the numbers entered make sense. For example, it does not allow zero or negative values for the number of clothes. The dropdown for wash type is also checked to make sure the user has chosen an option before starting the calculation.
These simple checks help prevent mistakes, make the app easier to use, and ensure that all calculations work correctly.
